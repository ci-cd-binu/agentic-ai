### üîπ I. Architecture Fundamentals (Concept & Flow)

**1Ô∏è‚É£ What are the main building blocks of a GenAI solution?**
‚úÖ **Answer:**
A GenAI system typically includes:

* **LLM layer:** Foundation model (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Llama).
* **Orchestrator layer:** Manages flow (LangChain, LlamaIndex, Semantic Kernel).
* **Knowledge retrieval layer:** Vector DB, retrievers, rankers.
* **Data governance layer:** Metadata, lineage, access control.
* **Application layer:** APIs, front-end, user workflows.
* **Observability layer:** Logging, metrics, guardrails.

---

**2Ô∏è‚É£ How do you decide whether a use case really needs RAG?**
‚úÖ **Answer:**
Use RAG when:

* Knowledge is **domain-specific** and not in the base LLM.
* Information **changes frequently**.
* You need **traceable, factual** responses.
  Avoid RAG when:
* Answers depend on **reasoning or logic** (e.g., math, summarization).
* You can **fine-tune** small models for static corpora.

---

**3Ô∏è‚É£ What are the two control patterns in RAG?**
‚úÖ **Answer:**

* **Pull pattern:** Orchestrator actively queries retriever and composes context.
* **Push pattern:** Agent dynamically decides when to retrieve, using tool-calling or function-calling.
  ‚Üí In both, **orchestrator owns control**, not retriever or LLM.

---

### üîπ II. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Who controls whether every query hits the vector database?**
‚úÖ **Answer:**
The **orchestrator/controller** (LangChain Agent or app logic).
It decides whether to retrieve based on cache, session memory, or semantic similarity thresholds.

---

**5Ô∏è‚É£ How do you reduce hallucinations in RAG?**
‚úÖ **Answer:**

* Use **document chunking + metadata** to retrieve precise context.
* Apply **prompt templating** (‚ÄúUse only the provided context‚Ä¶‚Äù).

* Fixed token chunking (e.g., 512‚Äì1024 tokens) for consistent embeddings.
  Hybrid approach works best.

---

**7Ô∏è‚É£ How do you ensure relevance of top-N retrieved chunks?**
‚úÖ **Answer:**
Combine **cosine similarity** filtering with **re-ranking models** (e.g., Cohere rerank or cross-encoder).

## ‚ö° 40 Advanced & Delightful GenAI Solution Architect Q&As

### üß± 1. What‚Äôs the difference between a ‚Äúretrieval pipeline‚Äù and a ‚Äúreasoning pipeline‚Äù in GenAI?

**Answer:**

* **Retrieval pipeline** = fetches knowledge (vector DB, hybrid search).
* **Reasoning pipeline** = interprets, applies logic, and generates final structured response.
  In RAG, both exist: *retrieval* finds relevant data; *reasoning* happens inside the LLM or agent graph.

Defines **how and when** retrieval happens ‚Äî e.g., only for unseen queries, or after semantic threshold < 0.85.
Policies can be rule-based or learned via feedback loops.

---

### üß© 4. Difference between LangChain retrievers and LlamaIndex retrievers?

**Answer:**
LangChain focuses on **chained abstractions** (retriever ‚Üí LLM ‚Üí parser),
