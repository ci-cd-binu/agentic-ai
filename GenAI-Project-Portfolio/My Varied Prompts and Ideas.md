### Data Plex -DQ and Lineage App

I want to setup with synthetic data, a basic data pipeline where data comes every 2 mins... then in gcp have a medallion arch built possibly in big query and other gcp services like data flow , cloud composer, gcs, etc..gcp native basically using my free gcp subscription. 
a simple but real world like example of data platform, data pipeline skills.... ensure syntehtic data has some data qaulity issues that we refine... essentialy also want an example using this data, pipeline , medallion to showcase 
how dataplex can 1. Provide value in Data Quality in an enterprise 2. Track data lineaage from data product across glod, sliver, bronze data objects.. shared some stored procedures to build these all.. 
so share synthetic data generation script using possiby faker or any other you think will be good or any built in data set in big query to learn and demo this as a small POC.
