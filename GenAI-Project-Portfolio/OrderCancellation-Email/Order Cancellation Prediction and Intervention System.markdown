## 2. Business Architecture

### 2.1 Business Context
The silviculture manufacturing business operates in a high-value, low-volume market where order cancellations lead to significant revenue loss and operational inefficiencies. The business process involves order placement, fulfillment, and delivery, with dealers acting as intermediaries between the manufacturer and customers. Cancellations often occur due to customer dissatisfaction, delivery delays, or financial constraints, which can be mitigated through timely and empathetic interventions.

### 2.2 Business Capabilities

- **Customer Profiling**: Analyzing customer data (e.g., sentiment, past interactions) to personalize interventions.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecasting cancellation likelihood and reasons using AI models.
- **Intervention Management**: Generating and dispatching tailored email communications.
- **Dealer Engagement**: Enabling dealers to review and send AI-generated emails.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Measuring the impact of interventions on cancellation rates and customer satisfaction.

### 2.3 Business Process Flow
1. **Order Ingestion**: Orders are received and logged into the order management system.
2. **Cancellation Prediction**: AI models analyze order data, customer profiles, and historical interactions to predict cancellation likelihood, stage, and reasons.
3. **Intervention Generation**: GenAI generates empathetic email templates based on cancellation reasons and customer context.
4. **Dealer Review**: Dealers receive email templates via a dashboard, review, and approve/modify them.
5. **Email Dispatch**: Approved emails are sent to customers.
6. **Feedback Loop**: Customer responses and cancellation outcomes are tracked to refine predictions and interventions.

### 2.4 Value Stream
- **Customer Retention**: Reduced cancellations lead to higher customer retention and lifetime value.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Proactive interventions minimize disruptions in fulfillment.
- **Revenue Protection**: Mitigating cancellations preserves revenue from high-value orders.
- **Dealer Empowerment**: AI tools enhance dealer confidence and effectiveness in customer communication.
