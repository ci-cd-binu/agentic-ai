# Prompt Engineering for Email Interventions

## 1. Overview
Prompt engineering involves designing inputs to guide LLMs toward desired outputs, optimizing for accuracy, tone, and context. Effective prompts are clear, context-rich, and tailored to the task, minimizing ambiguity and hallucinations. In production, prompt engineering requires iterative testing and versioning to ensure consistency.

## 2. Application in Use Case
In the order cancellation system, prompt engineering was critical for generating empathetic email drafts. The goal was to produce emails that:
- Addressed specific cancellation reasons (e.g., delivery delays, financial concerns).
- Reflected customer sentiment (e.g., frustrated, neutral).
- Aligned with the silviculture manufacturer’s brand voice (professional yet empathetic).

### Prompt Design
- **Base Prompt**:
  ```
  Given a customer profile [customer_details], cancellation reason [reason], and sentiment [sentiment], draft an empathetic email to address the customer’s concerns and encourage order retention. Use a professional yet warm tone, include a clear call-to-action, and avoid technical jargon.
  ```
- **Example Input**:
  ```
  Customer Details: Name: John Doe, Location: Oregon, Past Orders: 3, Loyalty Tier: Silver
  Cancellation Reason: Delivery delay of 2 weeks
  Sentiment: Frustrated
  ```
- **Output**:
  ```
  Subject: We’re Here to Help with Your Order

## 3. Technical Details
- **Prompt Components**:
  - **Context**: Customer profile, cancellation reason, sentiment.
  - **Instructions**: Tone (empathetic, professional), structure (subject, body, CTA), constraints (no jargon).
  - **Examples**: Few-shot learning with 5 sample emails to guide output format.
- **Tools**:
  - Vertex AI Prompt Playground for testing and iteration.
  - Python script for dynamic prompt construction:
    ```python
    def construct_prompt(customer, reason, sentiment):
        return f"""
        Given a customer profile {customer}, cancellation reason {reason}, and sentiment {sentiment}, 
        draft an empathetic email to address the customer’s concerns and encourage order retention. 
        Use a professional yet warm tone, include a clear call-to-action, and avoid technical jargon.
        """
    ```
- **Versioning**:
  - Stored prompts in Git for traceability.
  - Iterated 3 versions based on dealer feedback (e.g., added discount offers in V2).

## 4. Challenges and Mitigations
- **Challenge**: Inconsistent tone across emails.
  - **Mitigation**: Added explicit tone instructions and few-shot examples.
- **Challenge**: Hallucinations (e.g., incorrect customer details).
  - **Mitigation**: Used structured inputs and validated outputs against customer data.
- **Challenge**: Overly generic emails.
  - **Mitigation**: Incorporated customer-specific details (e.g., loyalty tier) and reason-specific solutions.

## 5. Interview Readiness
- **Key Points**:
  - Emphasize structured prompts with context, instructions, and examples.
  - Discuss few-shot vs. zero-shot prompting and their trade-offs.[](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/11/generative-ai-interview-questions/)
  - Highlight prompt versioning and testing for production reliability.
- **Recent Trends**:
  - Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for complex reasoning tasks.
  - Automated prompt optimization using tools like DSPy.[](https://www.udemy.com/course/llm-genai-interview-questions-and-answers-basic-to-expert/)
  - Dynamic prompt adaptation based on user feedback.
- **Articulation Tips**:
  - Explain how prompts were tailored to business needs (e.g., empathy for customer retention).
  - Discuss iterative refinement based on dealer feedback and A/B testing results.
