# Cloud APIs for Order Cancellation System

## 1. Overview
Cloud APIs enable integration with cloud services for compute, storage, AI, and orchestration. In GenAI systems, APIs provide access to LLMs, embedding models, databases, and serverless compute, ensuring scalability and ease of deployment. Production systems require robust API management for security, monitoring, and cost control.

## 2. Application in Use Case
The order cancellation system leveraged GCP APIs for:
- **Model Inference**: Vertex AI APIs for LLM and embedding model inference.
- **Data Storage**: BigQuery and Firestore APIs for data and email draft storage.
- **Orchestration**: Cloud Run and Pub/Sub APIs for batch processing and event triggers.
- **Email Delivery**: SendGrid API for sending approved emails.

## 3. Technical Details
- **Vertex AI API**:
  - Used for Mistral inference and `text-embedding-gecko`.
    ```python
    from google.cloud import aiplatform
    aiplatform.init(project='project-id', location='us-central1')
    endpoint = aiplatform.Endpoint('mistral-endpoint-id')
    response = endpoint.predict(instances=[prompt]).predictions
    ```
- **BigQuery API**:
  - Stored order and customer data.
    ```python
    from google.cloud import bigquery
    client = bigquery.Client()
    query = "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE cancellation_likelihood >= 0.8"
    results = client.query(query).result()
    ```
- **Cloud Run API**:
  - Triggered batch processing of orders.
    ```python
    from google.cloud import run_v2
    client = run_v2.ServicesClient()
    request = run_v2.RunJobRequest(name='projects/project-id/locations/us-central1/jobs/batch-job')
    client.run_job(request)
    ```
- **SendGrid API**:
  - Sent approved emails.
    ```python
    from sendgrid import SendGridAPIClient
    from sendgrid.helpers.mail import Mail
    message = Mail(
        from_email='dealer@company.com',
        to_emails='customer@email.com',
        subject='Order Update',
        html_content=email_content
    )
    sg = SendGridAPIClient('api-key')
    sg.send(message)
    ```

## 4. Challenges and Mitigations
- **Challenge**: API rate limits during peak loads.
  - **Mitigation**: Implemented exponential backoff and request batching.
- **Challenge**: Cost overruns from frequent API calls.
  - **Mit “[Ideal Response Truncated to Meet Character Limit]**

System: The response was truncated due to exceeding the character limit. Below is the completion of the **Cloud APIs** document and the remaining documents (**Production Experience** and **Recent Trends**) to fully address your request. Each document continues to leverage the order cancellation use case in the silviculture manufacturing domain, ensuring depth and relevance for GenAI interview preparation. The artifacts are structured to demonstrate expertise in LLM selection, prompt engineering, embedding models, vector databases, RAG, chunking strategy, cloud APIs, production experience, and recent trends (Agentic AI, Multi-Agent Systems, CrewAI, PhiData).

# Cloud APIs for Order Cancellation System

## 1. Overview
Cloud APIs enable seamless integration with cloud services for compute, storage, AI, and orchestration in GenAI systems. They provide access to LLMs, embedding models, databases, and serverless compute, ensuring scalability, security, and ease of deployment. In production, robust API management is critical for handling rate limits, monitoring usage, and controlling costs.

## 2. Application in Use Case
The order cancellation system leveraged Google Cloud Platform (GCP) APIs to support prediction, email generation, and intervention workflows:
- **Model Inference**: Vertex AI APIs for LLM (Mistral) and embedding model (`text-embedding-gecko`) inference.
- **Data Storage and Retrieval**: BigQuery for order and customer data, Firestore for email drafts.
- **Orchestration**: Cloud Run for batch processing, Pub/Sub for event-driven triggers.
- **Email Delivery**: SendGrid API for sending dealer-approved emails to customers.

## 3. Technical Details
- **Vertex AI API**:
  - Used for Mistral inference and embedding generation.
  - Example: Email generation.
    ```python
    from google.cloud import aiplatform
    aiplatform.init(project='project-id', location='us-central1')
    endpoint = aiplatform.Endpoint('mistral-endpoint-id')
    response = endpoint.predict(instances=[{"prompt": prompt}]).predictions
    ```
  - Embedding: Generated vectors for customer interactions.
    ```python
    endpoint = aiplatform.Endpoint('embedding-endpoint-id')
    embeddings = endpoint.predict(instances=[text]).predictions
    ```
- **BigQuery API**:
  - Stored and queried order data for cancellation predictions.
    ```python
    from google.cloud import bigquery
    client = bigquery.Client()
    query = "SELECT order_id, customer_id, cancellation_likelihood FROM orders WHERE cancellation_likelihood >= 0.8"
    results = client.query(query).result()
    ```
- **Cloud Run API**:
  - Triggered batch processing of high-risk orders.
    ```python
    from google.cloud import run_v2
    client = run_v2.ServicesClient()
    request = run_v2.RunJobRequest(name='projects/project-id/locations/us-central1/jobs/batch-job')
    client.run_job(request)
    ```
- **Firestore API**:
  - Stored email drafts for dealer review.
    ```python
    from google.cloud import firestore
    db = firestore.Client()
    db.collection('email_drafts').add({
        'order_id': '123',
        'email_content': email_content,
        'status': 'pending'
    })
    ```
- **SendGrid API**:
  - Sent approved emails to customers.
    ```python
    from sendgrid import SendGridAPIClient
    from sendgrid.helpers.mail import Mail
    message = Mail(
        from_email='dealer@company.com',
        to_emails='customer@email.com',
        subject='Order Update',
        html_content=email_content
    )
    sg = SendGridAPIClient('SENDGRID_API_KEY')
    sg.send(message)
    ```

## 4. Challenges and Mitigations
- **Challenge**: API rate limits during peak batch processing.
  - **Mitigation**: Implemented exponential backoff and request batching to stay within limits; used Pub/Sub to queue requests during spikes.
- **Challenge**: Cost overruns from frequent Vertex AI API calls.
  - **Mitigation**: Optimized batch sizes (100 orders per call) and cached frequent embedding queries in Firestore; monitored costs via Cloud Billing API.
- **Challenge**: Security risks with API key management.
  - **Mitigation**: Used GCP Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles for authentication, stored keys in Secret Manager, and avoided hardcoding credentials (referencing prior conversation on avoiding `gcloud auth application-default login`).[](https://docs.phidata.com/agents)
- **Challenge**: Debugging API failures in production.
  - **Mitigation**: Integrated Cloud Logging and Monitoring to track API errors and latency; set up alerts for failure thresholds.
