# Embedding Models and LLM Knowledge

## 1. Overview
Embedding models convert text into numerical vectors, enabling tasks like semantic search, clustering, and classification. LLM knowledge encompasses understanding model architectures (e.g., Transformers), training paradigms (e.g., pretraining, fine-tuning), and their application to specific domains. In GenAI systems, embeddings and LLMs work together to process and generate contextually relevant outputs.

## 2. Application in Use Case
In the order cancellation system, embedding models were used to:
- **Customer Sentiment Analysis**: Classify customer interactions (e.g., emails, call transcripts) as positive, neutral, or negative to inform email tone.
- **Cancellation Reason Clustering**: Group similar cancellation reasons for targeted interventions.
LLM knowledge guided model selection, fine-tuning, and optimization for email generation.

### Embedding Model Usage
- **Model**: Googleâ€™s `text-embedding-gecko` on Vertex AI.
- **Tasks**:
  - Sentiment Analysis: Embedded customer interaction texts and classified using a logistic regression model trained on labeled data.
  - Reason Clustering: Embedded cancellation reasons and applied k-means clustering to identify patterns (e.g., delivery delays, pricing issues).
- **Output**: 768-dimensional vectors per text input, used for downstream tasks.

### LLM Knowledge Application
- **Architecture**: Leveraged Transformer-based models (Mistral) with attention mechanisms for contextual understanding.[](https://takeitoutamber.medium.com/top-10-must-know-genai-with-llm-large-language-model-interview-questions-e91c4079d37c)
- **Fine-Tuning**: Applied LoRA to adapt Mistral to silviculture-specific email generation.
- **Optimization**: Used mixed-precision training to reduce memory usage during inference.

## 3. Technical Details
- **Embedding Pipeline**:
  - Preprocessing: Tokenized and cleaned text using spaCy.
  - Embedding: Called Vertex AI API:
    ```python
    from google.cloud import aiplatform
    aiplatform.init(project='project-id', location='us-central1')
    endpoint = aiplatform.Endpoint('embedding-endpoint-id')
    embeddings = endpoint.predict(instances=[text]).predictions
    ```
  - Storage: Stored embeddings in BigQuery for analysis.
- **LLM Configuration**:
  - Model: Mistral-7B, 12 layers, 4096 hidden size.
  - Fine-Tuning: LoRA with rank=8, alpha=16, trained on 10,000 emails.
  - Inference: Batch size=32, max tokens=512.

## 4. Challenges and Mitigations
- **Challenge**: Embedding drift due to evolving customer language.
  - **Mitigation**: Periodically retrained embedding model on new interaction data.
- **Challenge**: High-dimensional embedding storage costs.
  - **Mitigation**: Applied PCA to reduce dimensionality to 256 with minimal accuracy loss.
- **Challenge**: Limited LLM domain knowledge.
  - **Mitigation**: Fine-tuned on silviculture-specific data and used RAG for real-time knowledge augmentation.
