## What is Data Fabric?
A data fabric is an architectural approach that provides a unified and consistent way to access, manage, and govern data across an organization. It essentially creates a network or "fabric" that connects various data sources, allowing them to be integrated, transformed, and shared seamlessly.

Data fabrics are particularly advantageous for organizations with a geographically diverse presence or multiple data sources.
